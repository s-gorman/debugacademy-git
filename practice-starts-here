Did you have any issues downloading any of the following?  Please let us know before we go any farther.

Xcode (Mac users only)
Please download this from the Mac App Store. There is a program on your computer named 'App store' which you use to download Xcode.

Git bash (Windows users only) (https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

Sublime Text 3 https://www.sublimetext.com/3. Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code and allows you to open, edit, and save code files.

1 - Using terminal/gitbash, create a folder named gitpractice on your machine's desktop. This can be done by navigating to your desktop, then using the mkdir command:
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir gitpractice
cd gitpractice
pwd
ls -la
mkdir commands
ls -la
cd ..
pwd
How can we get into the folder “commands” within our gitpractice folder from here?

2 - If you do not have git on your computer please install it following the directions at the top of this page:  https://github.com/s-gorman/debugacademy-git
